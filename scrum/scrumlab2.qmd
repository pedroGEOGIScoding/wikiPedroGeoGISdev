ðŸ“˜ **SCRUM Lab#SC02: Spaguetti Challenge**

<mark>The Agile Spaghetti Challenge Tower is an innovative team-building activity that embodies Agile principles.</mark>

- Participants **work in teams to construct the tallest tower using only spaghetti and marshmallows** within a time constraint.

This exercise mirrors **Agile's iterative approach, encouraging collaboration, adaptability, and quick decision-making.** Teams continuously inspect and adapt their tower, incorporating feedback from short cycles to optimize performance.

The challenge emphasizes Agile values such as flexibility, communication, and incremental progress. It offers a hands-on experience for participants to grasp Agile concepts in a tangible context, fostering a deeper understanding of teamwork and Agile methodologies.

# Introduction

## The Set Up

Students work in teams of four to build the tallest tower they can using only the provided materials.

## Build, Launch (and Fail!)


With only 18 minutes to build their towers, teams often follow a similar construction timeline:

- ~3 minutes: Figuring out who is in charge
- ~10 minutes: Planning
- ~4 minutes: Taping spaghetti together
- ~1 minute: Putting their marshmallow on top
- ~1 second: Watching the tower crumble under the (surprising) weight of the marshmallow
