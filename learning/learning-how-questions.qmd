## Answering the useful (right?) questions
Questions that begin with the words **why, who, what, and how** are necessary and paramount because they help to **clarify information, to seek additional details, and to better understand a situation**. Besides, they play a crucial role in **facilitating communication** and understanding.

These words are often used to ask **open-ended questions**, which are questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Asking open-ended questions allows for more **in-depth conversation and debate** and can help to uncover important information or insights.

For example,

- asking **"Why did this happen?"** can help to identify the underlying causes of a particular event,
- while asking **"What are the consequences of this decision?"** can help to anticipate and evaluate the potential impacts of a choice. 

Overall, asking why, who, what, and how can help to **improve communication**, to **facilitate decision-making**, and to **deepen understanding**.
