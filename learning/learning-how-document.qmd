## Write

Before starting, [write](/learning/learning-how-writing.qmd).

## Some ideas about documentation

### Start

`Start`: always start. No matter what. Start small, if necessary. Start bad, if necessary. Start in a piece of paper, if necessary. But **start**.

### Document is paramount

`Good documentation is key`: always apply pareto. Good documentation is the basis for everything: learning, coding, communicating and growing. No make a mistake: **document is paramout.**

### Make documenting easy

Choose the right documentation tools: [quarto](https://quarto.org/){.external} 

### It is an habit

`It is an habit`: make it a part of your culture, part of your code, part of your habits. **So code and document. Document and code**:

  - `Timing`: learn the `when`. Document the right things at the right time is very relevant: it allow you to get in the documenting flow.
  - `When` you hare happy with a nice solution: explain it to yourserlf and document.
  - `When` you think it is a relevant knowledge: explain it to yourserlf and document.
  - Explain the decision-making to get to that solution: explain the `why`. And `how` do you get there.
  - Regarding that solution, that note, that writing with your context. Remember: [Lateralization](/books/TheMatterWithThings.qmd#the-matter-with-things). **Iterate**.
  - `Keep it simple`
