| Spring Boot Auto-configuration | Automatically configures application components based on the dependencies present in the classpath, reducing manual setup and enhancing development efficiency.|
| Spring Boot Actuator  | A set of production-ready features providing insights into the application's runtime behavior, health, and metrics. Enables monitoring, management, and troubleshooting in a production environment.|
| Spring Boot DevTools  | Enhances developer experience with automatic application restarts, live reloading, and other tools that accelerate the iterative development process. Facilitates a smoother and more efficient development workflow.|
| model | It represents graphically an abstraction of the same reality or of a service. It solves problems or needs through a set of black boxes (DDD) that depend only on its previous state and its runtime input. Its conception and implementation is translated into the creation of classes and the relationships between them by means of the UML. The UML will be based on previously defined architectures adapted to the needs of the project. |
