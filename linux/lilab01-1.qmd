ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#LI01-1: Choose Linux**

This lab may serve many purposes, and you need some idea of **what you want to use your lab to achieve**.

- If you're just exploring what's possible on Linux, installing `Linux Mint`,  `CentOS` or `Ubuntu` offers you a flexible and basic environment.
- You may install `OpenSuse` for more concrete purposes and test these distributions on a spare computer, a Raspberry Pi, or as a **virtual machine (VM) or container**.
- If you want your journey to begin at its destination, you can install **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** on a supported platform. This gets you started with **enterprise-quality Linux**, which means that once you perfect your setup, it's ready to migrate into **production**.
