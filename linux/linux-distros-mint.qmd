# Keep your Linux updated

Open your terminal and execute:

- ``sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get autoremove``

Or you may go through GUI: **Update Manager**:

## Install Developer Tools

### Make a Bash Script Executable

1. Create a **new text file** with all the software you need with a **.sh extension** and code it as ``#!/bin/bash`` (that is, copy that line to the top of it)

[devtools.sh](https://gist.github.com/AlbertProfe/aa473648bf9ecd8fd106be7facfb90a1){.external}

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/AlbertProfe/aa473648bf9ecd8fd106be7facfb90a1.js"></script>
</details>

2. **Make the file executable**, open the command line and run: ``chmod u+x devtools.sh``. You are giving permissions to execute this file: **it will grant only the owner of that file execution permissions.**

3. Run it: ``./devtools.sh`` or double-click the icon


4. Be careful with certain packages and tools do not work under ``apt get install``, you will need to use ``snap``



``` js
snap
sudo mv /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref ~/Documents/nosnap.backup
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd

intellij-idea-educational
visual code educational
sudo snap install intellij-idea-educational --classic

chrome
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

obsidian
wget https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.0.3/obsidian_1.0.3_amd64.snap
sudo snap install --dangerous obsidian_1.0.3_amd64.snap --classic

visual code educational
wget https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/1ad8d514439d5077d2b0b7ee64d2ce82a9308e5a/code_1.74.1-1671015296_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./code_1.74.1-1671015296_amd64.deb
```

### Create an Installer Bash Script  

``` js
#!/bin/bash

# Read the CSV file and install each app
installed=0
not_installed=0
now=`date`
sudo apt-get update
echo -e "\nInstall execution long" >> installed_apps.log
echo -e "$now\n" >> installed_apps.log
while IFS=';' read -r app package_manager; do
    if [ "$package_manager" = "apt" ]; then
        if ! command -v "$app" &> /dev/null; then
            sudo apt-get install -y "$app"
            echo -e "\t$app installed/error" >> installed_apps.log
            ((installed++))
        else
            echo -e "\t$app already exists" >> installed_apps.log
            ((not_installed++))
        fi
    elif [ "$package_manager" = "snap" ]; then
        if ! command -v "$app" &> /dev/null; then
            sudo snap install "$app"
            echo -e "\t$app installed/error" >> installed_apps.log
            ((installed++))
        else
            echo -e "\t$app already exists" >> installed_apps.log
            ((not_installed++))
        fi
    fi
done < apps.csv

echo "Total apps: $((installed + not_installed))"
echo "Installed/tried apps: $installed"
echo "Existing apps: $not_installed"

echo -e "\nTotal apps: $((installed + not_installed))" >> installed_apps.log
echo "Installed/tried apps: $installed" >> installed_apps.log
echo "Existing apps: $not_installed" >> installed_apps.log
```


## Timeshift

**[Timeshift](https://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/timeshift) is a system restore utility which takes snapshots of the system at regular intervals**. These snapshots can be restored at a later date to undo system changes. Creates incremental snapshots using rsync or BTRFS snapshots using BTRFS tools.

## TMCBeans MOOC Helsinki Java 2023


1. You can install OpenJDK with the following terminal command (works for Ubuntu):
   
  ``` js
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk

  ```

2. From Linux Mint 20 onwards, a file called nosnap.pref needs to be either moved or removed from /etc/apt/preferences.d/ before Snap can be installed.
   
  ``` js
   sudo mv /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref ~/Documents/nosnap.backup

  ```

3. With the file removed from its original location, the package database needs to be updated next:
   
  ``` js
   sudo apt update

  ``` 
  (previous upgrade)
  
4. To now install snap from the Software Manager application, search for snapd and click Install. Alternatively, snapd can be installed from the command line:
   
  ``` js
   sudo apt install snapd

  ```

5. **log out** and then **log in**
   
6. To test your system, **install the hello-world snap** and make sure it **runs** correctly:
  
  ``` js
      snap install hello-world

  ```
  
    hello-world 6.4 from Canonical✓ installed

7.  Test if snapd is installed:

  ``` js
    hello-world
    
  ```
  
    Hello World!

8.  Eventually, install TMCBeans
   
  ``` js
    sudo snap install --classic tmcbeans

  ```

**Simple Screen Recorder** is, despite its name, an <mark>actually feature-rich screen recorder</mark>.

The name reflects the fact that it **is simple to use unlike many other free screen recording applications available**. It can be easily configured to start recording from an intuitive wizard-like interface.

It can record the entire screen or part of it directly. The recording can be paused and resumed at any time. Many different file formats and codecs are supported. To perform an X11 recording, all it takes is selecting an area on the root window with the mouse, choosing an output file and pressing record, either by using the mouse or using a hotkey.
