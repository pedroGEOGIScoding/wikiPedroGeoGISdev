ðŸ“˜ **System**

In a Linux system, **the file system is organized into a hierarchical structure, starting with the root directory** (represented by a forward slash `/`). The root directory contains several subdirectories, including `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/lib`, `/media`, `/mnt`, `/opt`, `/sbin`, `/tmp`, and `/usr`.

These [directories](https://documentation.suse.com/fr-fr/sles/15-GA/html/SLES-all/cha-filesystems.html){.external} contain system executables, configuration files, user home directories, libraries, removable media, mount points, optional software, system executables, temporary files, and shared software, respectively.

Other directories, such as `/dev`, `/proc`, and `/sys`, contain special files that provide access to hardware devices and kernel information.
