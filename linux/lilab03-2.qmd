ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#LI03-2: Manage files**

-   Create directories for each department (sales, marketing, human resources, IT, engineering) at the root of the filesystem.
-   [Configure standard Linux permissions and ownership](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/manage-permissions)Â such that each group only has access to its own departmental directories. For example, the sales group has access to theÂ `/sales`Â directory but not to other departments' directories.
    -   After completing and testing the previous step,Â [configure ACL permissions](https://opensource.com/article/20/3/external-drives-linux)Â to permit the marketing department to have read access to theÂ `/sales`Â directory.
    -   Use ACL permissions to permit one user account to have read permission to theÂ `/IT`Â directory.
    -   ConfigureÂ [SGID and the sticky bit](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit)Â on theÂ `/marketing`Â directory.
-   Ensure that two of your existing user accounts are now members of the marketing group.
    -   Use each account to create one file in theÂ `/marketing`Â directory.
    -   Test whether one of those accounts can delete the file created by the other account (they should not be able to, due to the sticky bit).
-   Create a file calledÂ `unchangeable.txt`, set the immutable attribute on it, and then delete the file.
-   ConfigureÂ [file links](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linking-linux-explained).
    -   Create a file namedÂ `LinksTest.txt`Â in theÂ `/opt`Â directory, and then create a hard link to it in theÂ `/tmp`Â directory. Use Vim to add a line of text to the file through theÂ `/opt/LinksTest.txt`Â path, and then display the file's contents by using theÂ `/tmp/LinksTest.txt`Â file path.
    -   Create a symlink toÂ `/tmp/LinksTest.txt`Â in the root user's home directory and view the file's contents.
    -   Delete theÂ `/tmp/LinksTest.txt`Â file, and then attempt to view the file's contents through theÂ `/root/LinksTest.txt`Â symlink.
-   Create 10 files in theÂ `/tmp`Â directory, and then useÂ `tar`Â andÂ `gzip`Â to bundle and compress the files.
    -   Delete the 10 original files and then restore them from your tarball.
-   Use theÂ `find`Â command to search for the test files in the department directories. Do this task first as the root user, then as a user who is a member of the group that owns the directory, and finally as a user who is not a member of the group that owns the directory.
-   At the command line only, practice mounting and unmounting ISO images.
-   Copy a file from the ISO to a directory on the Linux installation.
-   ConfigureÂ [LVM](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/creating-logical-volumes):
    -   Designate two sections of 50MB each of your remaining empty hard disk drive space to be physical volumes (PVs) used by LVM.
    -   Combine those to PVs into a single volume group, and then configure a single logical volume (LV) that is 100MB.
    -   Create a directory to serve as a mount point for this LV and add an entry to theÂ `/etc/fstab`Â so that it is mounted during the system bootup.
