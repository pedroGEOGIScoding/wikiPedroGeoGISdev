ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#LI01-2: Install at least three distributions**

-   Create separate boot, var, home, swap, and filesystem root partitions (five partitions total). Leave at least 100MB of empty, unused, unpartitioned hard disk space for a future task.
-   Choose whatever desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are available for your selected distributions.
-   Create a user during installation, and make that user the administrator. This grants the userÂ `sudo`Â permissions.
-   Once installation is complete, explore the built-in help features:
    -   Use man pages to research theÂ `fstab`Â file.
    -   What are the differences between the various man page sections? Admins primarily use sections 1, 5, and 8---why?
    -   How can you do a keyword search within man pages?
    -   What can be found atÂ `/usr/share/doc`?
    -   Explore whatever GUI help files might be available.
-   Complete the Vim tutorial (the command isÂ `vimtutor`) to get comfortable withÂ [Vim](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/four-things-vim). You can useÂ [Nano](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/four-things-nano)Â if you prefer. BeÂ *certain*Â you can create, open, edit, save, and close configuration files before proceeding any further with these activities.
-   Try configuring the installations for a specific time zone by using theÂ `tzselect`Â command.
-   Select one installation as your primary lab computer. Designate it as the "server" and select a second installation as a "client." You will use these two systems in the remaining activities.This lab may serve many purposes, and you need some idea of **what you want to use your lab to achieve**.
