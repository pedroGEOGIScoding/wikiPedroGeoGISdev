description: "Entire books are available on Quarkus, microservices, MicroProfile, Spring, and Kubernetes. However, they tend to focus only on each specific topic. This book covers how to combine these topics into an effective and integrated development and deployment stack. Kubernetes-native microservices utilize and integrate with Kubernetes features naturally and efficiently. The result is a productive developer experience that is consistent with the expectations of Kubernetes platform administrators."
