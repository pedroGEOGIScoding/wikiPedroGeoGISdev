## What is OpenShift?

``OpenShift`` is a family of containerization software offerings created by open-source software provider Red Hat. **According to the company, Kubernetes is the kernel of distributed systems, while ``OpenShift`` is the distribution.**

> At its core, ``OpenShift`` is a cloud-based **Kubernetes** container platform that's considered both containerization software and a platform-as-a-service (PaaS).

> It’s also partly built on **Docker**, another popular containerization platform. 

``OpenShift`` offers consistent security, built-in monitoring, centralized policy management, and compatibility with Kubernetes container workloads. It’s fast, enables self-service provisioning, and integrates with a variety of tools. In other words, there’s no vendor lock-in.

Previously known as Origin, the open-source platform, ``OpenShift`` OKD lets developers create, test, and deploy applications on the cloud. It also supports several programming languages, including Go, Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, and Java.
