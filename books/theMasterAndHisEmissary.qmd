## Why is the brain divided?

The difference between right and left hemispheres has been puzzled over for centuries. Drawing upon a vast body of brain research, the renowned psychiatrist, author, and thinker Iain McGilchrist reveals that the difference between the two sides is profound―two whole, coherent, but incompatible ways of experiencing the world.

> The detail-oriented left hemisphere prefers mechanisms to living things and is inclined to self-interest, while the right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility, and generosity.

`McGilchrist` takes the reader on a journey through the history of Western culture, illustrating **the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought and belief of thinkers and artists from the ancient to the modern, from Aeschylus to Magritte**.

He ultimately argues that, despite its inferior grasp of reality, the left hemisphere is increasingly taking precedence in today’s world―with potentially disastrous consequences.

## Key-ideas

- The **different functions of the two hemispheres** of your brain and what this means for how you experience the world.
- How **language and categorisation** can stifle and give the false illusion of understanding our own reality.
- How the **types of attention we pay** to the world dramatically impact the way we perceive the world.
