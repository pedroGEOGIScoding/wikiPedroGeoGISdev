> For me, the paradigm that Quarkus brings is a major one for Java. This is one of these moments in your career when you should take stock and explore a new technology in-depth! This book makes it easy to do that, providing like-for-like examples of your favorite Spring development patterns mapped to their Quarkus equivalents (don’t panic, there are many similarities) and giving you an understanding of the fundamentals at play under the hood.
