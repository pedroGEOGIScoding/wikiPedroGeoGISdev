2. **Index Funds**: These are investment funds that aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500.

3. **Startups**: Investing in startups involves providing capital to early-stage companies in exchange for equity, with the potential for high returns if the company succeeds.

4. **Bonds**: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations, offering periodic interest payments and return of principal upon maturity.

5. **Real Estate**: Real estate investments involve buying and owning physical properties, such as residential or commercial real estate, to generate rental income or capital gains.

6. **Cryptocurrency**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital assets that use blockchain technology for transactions and have gained popularity as speculative investments.

7. **Futures**: Futures contracts allow investors to speculate on the future price of commodities, currencies (Forex, Foreign exchange market), or financial instruments, often used for hedging or trading purposes.
