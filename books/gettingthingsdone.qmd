## More info

In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work. In `Getting Things Done`, veteran coach and management consultant **David Allen** shares the breakthrough methods for **stress-free performance.**

::: {.callout-note}
## Please, relax
Allen's premise is simple: **our productivity is directly proportional to our ability to relax.** 

Only when our minds are ``clear`` and our ``thoughts`` are organized can we achieve **effective productivity and unleash our creative potential.**
:::

The primary reason for organizing is to reduce cognitive load: to eliminate the need to constantly be thinking, `What do I need to do about this?`

## Overview


- If we don’t appropriately manage the ``open loops`` in our life, **our attention will get pulled.**
- ``Overwhelm`` comes from:
    - not **clarifying** what your intended **outcome** is,
    - not **deciding** what the very next action is, and
    - not  being **aware** of your outcome and next-previous-action.
- You need to transform all the ``stuff`` you attract and accumulate into a **clear inventory**.

## Structure

Getting things done requires **two basic components:**

- `Outcome`: Defining what “done” means
- `Action`: What “doing” looks like

::: {.callout-note}
## Relevance of metrics
We need some `real metrics` to feed our decision-making and be aware to where we are going.
:::

You need to **control commitments, projects, and actions** in two ways:

- `Horizontally`. Maintaining coherence across all the activities in which you are involved
- `Vertically`. Managing thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects.

## Five tips

Here are a few takeaways and tactics:

###  Done
Getting things done requires defining what ``done`` means and what ``doing`` looks like.

> What is ``done``? What is ``doing``?

> We need to transform all the ‘stuff’ we attract and accumulate into a **clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information.**

### Attention

Mastering your workflow involves capturing **what has your attention**, clarifying what it means, putting it where it belongs, reviewing it frequently, and engaging with it.

> How de you see the world? What is your `narrative`?

> You must use your mind to **get things off your mind** and focus, if not: **confussion** and with confussion comes very bad decision-making.

> Until your thoughts **have been clarified and decisions have been made** (and create a `pointer`) your brain can’t give up the job.

::: {.column-margin}
`pointer`: decision, processes, targets, outocmes are data, information. The resulting data must be stored in a system that you absolutely know you will access and think about when you need to.
:::
 
### Now!

If an action will **take less than two minutes**, it should be done at the moment it is defined.

> Save energy, do it now!

### Anxiety

``Anxiety`` and ``guilt`` don’t come from having too much to do; it comes from **breaking agreements with yourself.**

> Your mind is for having ideas, not for holding them.

> It’s a waste of time and energy to keep thinking **about something that you make no progress on.**
