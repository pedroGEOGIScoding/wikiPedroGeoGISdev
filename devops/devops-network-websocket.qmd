# Overview


``WebSockets`` is a <mark>communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server</mark>. It provides a persistent connection that allows for efficient data exchange without the need for repeated HTTP requests.

``WebSockets`` are particularly useful for applications that require instant updates, such as real-time chat applications, collaborative editing tools, and live data streaming.

In React, you can leverage the power of ``WebSockets`` by using libraries like ``Socket.IO`` or the native ``WebSocket`` API. These libraries enable you to establish a WebSocket connection, send and receive messages, and handle events for seamless real-time communication in your React applications.

# Websockets

`WebSocket` is a computer communications protocol, <mark>providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.</mark>

The current API specification allowing web applications to use this protocol is known as **WebSockets**.

`WebSockets` are a communication protocol that provides a persistent, full-duplex connection between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP connections, which are stateless and require the client to initiate each request, `WebSockets` allow for real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server.

Here are some basic ideas and features of `WebSockets`:

1. **Persistent Connection**: `WebSockets` establish a <mark>persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing for continuous communication without the need to send multiple HTTP requests.<mark>

2. **Full-Duplex Communication**: `WebSockets` enable full-duplex communication, meaning both the client and the server can send and receive data simultaneously. This bidirectional nature allows for real-time updates and interactive applications.

3. **Lightweight Overhead**: The `WebSocket` protocol has a minimal overhead compared to HTTP. After the initial handshake, the data exchange occurs using a much smaller header, resulting in reduced latency and bandwidth usage.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: `WebSockets` use an event-driven architecture, where the server can push data to the connected clients without the need for explicit requests. This makes it suitable for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, live dashboards, and multiplayer games.

5. **Wide Browser Support**: `WebSockets` are supported by modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. This allows for cross-browser compatibility and ensures that `WebSockets` can be utilized in a variety of web-based applications.

6. **Security**: `WebSocket` connections can be <mark>secured using encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.</mark>

7. **Compatibility with Existing Web Infrastructure**: `WebSockets` can work alongside existing web infrastructure and technologies. They can be seamlessly integrated into web applications that utilize other protocols like HTTP or REST, allowing for a combination of traditional request-response communication and real-time updates through `WebSockets`.

`WebSockets` provide a powerful mechanism for building interactive and real-time web applications, enabling efficient and seamless communication between clients and servers.

# Websocket vs. HTTP

`WebSocket` is distinct from `HTTP`. Both protocols are located at **layer 7 in the OSI model** and depend on `TCP` at layer 4.

Although they are different, the [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API){.external} <mark>is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries</mark>, thus making it compatible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

# Websocket client

## Instance methods

`WebSocket.close()`: Closes the connection.

`WebSocket.send()`: Enqueues data to be transmitted.

## Events

Listen to these events using `addEventListener()` or by assigning an event listener to the oneventname property of this interface.

`close`: Fired when a connection with a WebSocket is closed. Also available via the onclose property

`error`: Fired when a connection with a WebSocket has been closed because of an error, such as when some data couldn't be sent. Also available via the onerror property.

`message`: Fired when data is received through a WebSocket. Also available via the onmessage property.

`open`: Fired when a connection with a WebSocket is opened. Also available via the onopen property.

## Example: Websocket client `React`

```js
// Creates new WebSocket object with a wss URI as the parameter
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://game.example.com/ws/updates');

// Fired when a connection with a WebSocket is opened
socket.onopen = function () {
  setInterval(function() {
    if (socket.bufferedAmount == 0)
      socket.send(getUpdateData());
  }, 50);
};

// Fired when data is received through a WebSocket
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  handleUpdateData(event.data);
};

// Fired when a connection with a WebSocket is closed
socket.onclose = function(event) {
  onSocketClose(event);
};

// Fired when a connection with a WebSocket has been closed because of an error
socket.onerror = function(event) {
  onSocketError(event);
};
