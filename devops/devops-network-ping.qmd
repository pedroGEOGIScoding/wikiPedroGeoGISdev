# Overview



<mark>Ping, a network utility, is used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It also measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer. </mark>

The name "ping" comes from **the sonar sound used by submarines to detect other objects in the water.** 

In the context of networking, "ping" is analogous to sending a signal to determine if a remote host is responsive.

The basic syntax of the ping command is as follows:

```bash
ping [options] destination
```

Here, "destination" can be an IP address or a domain name. The command sends **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** Echo Request messages to the destination and waits for Echo Reply messages. The round-trip time and other statistics are displayed as output.

Ping is a valuable tool for network troubleshooting and diagnostics, providing insights into network connectivity and latency.
