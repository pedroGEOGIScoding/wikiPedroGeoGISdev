> In the 2024 software development ecosystem, thorough **documentation** is essential for several reasons:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: Documentation ensures that project knowledge is not siloed within individuals but shared across the team and organization[.
2. **Onboarding**: Well-documented projects significantly reduce the time needed for new team members to become productive.
3. **Maintenance**: Clear documentation makes it easier to maintain and update software over time, reducing technical debt.
4. **User Adoption**: Comprehensive documentation, like that of Kubernetes, facilitates user adoption and reduces support overhead.
5. **Collaboration**: Documentation fosters collaboration among team members and with the wider community, especially in open-source projects.
