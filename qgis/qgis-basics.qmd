ðŸ“˜ **QGIS**

QGIS is a **free and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS)** that allows users to **view, edit, and analyze geospatial data**. Originally known as Quantum GIS, it provides a user-friendly interface for working with maps, spatial databases, and geographic analysis. QGIS supports numerous vector, raster, and database formats and is widely used by professionals, researchers, and students in geography, urban planning, environmental science, and many other fields.

## What is QGIS?

QGIS (originally called Quantum GIS) is a **cross-platform free and open-source desktop geographic information system** (GIS) application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data.

### Key Features

- **Multi-platform support**: Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices
- **Format support**: Reads and writes numerous vector, raster, and database formats
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture allows for custom functionality
- **Standards compliant**: Supports OGC standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, etc.)
- **Professional cartography**: Advanced map composition and printing capabilities

### QGIS vs Commercial GIS

| Feature | QGIS | Commercial GIS |

- **Points**: Discrete locations (cities, landmarks)
- **Lines**: Linear features (roads, rivers)
- **Polygons**: Area features (countries, lakes)

### Raster Data
- **Satellite imagery**: Earth observation data
- **Digital elevation models**: Terrain data
- **Scanned maps**: Historical or paper maps

### Database Connections
- **PostGIS**: PostgreSQL spatial extension
- **SpatiaLite**: SQLite spatial extension
- **Web services**: WMS, WFS, WCS
