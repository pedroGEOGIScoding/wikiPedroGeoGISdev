ðŸ“˜ **Linux Lab#SE03-2: Library/Book Sprint Zero**

Before define what a [Sprint Zero really is](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/sprint-zero/){.external}, letâ€™s see what it isnâ€™t.

- A **Sprint Zero is not** the phase in which:

    - the team is put together: a team must already be in place.
    - for setting up infrastructure which should already be implemented or easily implemented on demand.
    - should not involve adding products to a backlog or consider planning as classical project management.

The main goal of a Sprint Zero is **to deliver some usable value that can be built upon by the next team**. Sprint Zeros are required to:

- Create the projectâ€™s `skeleton`, including research spikes.
- `Keep design minimal`.
- Develop a small number of `stories` to completion.
- Be low velocity and lightweight.

More specifically, the deliverables of a Sprint Zero should be as follows:

- A `usable` piece of code, however small.
- A `minimal` environment for writing code.
- A `prioritization` of features or a list of stories.
- A `release plan` assigning each story to a Sprint.
- A plan for the most **likely** implementation of `features`.

## Architecture and first draft

### Tasks/Requirements list

Let's take the example of the **Library** [Lab#SE03-1](/javase/selab3-1.qmd) to define a `graph` with the requirements/tasks for the Sprint Zero deriverables:

### Onion Architecture

![Onion Architecture](/images/javase/onion_architecture.jpg){width="40%"}


The layers are of [Onion Architecture](){.external} and sublayers are:

- `Infrastructure`, where our database, file system, or any external web service we depend on live.
- `Tests`: unit, integration, end-to-end. How we validate our business cases. 
- `User Interface`, how our users interact with the code we have built. - Application Services layer (sometimes known as the Transport/Access Layer). 
- `Domain Services` layer. In this layer is where the majority of our business logic lives, it carries out the operations to turn A into B, input into output, egg into chicken. 
- The core layer, the `Domain Model` layer which is the representation of the high level data objects we use.

## Pieces of code

### UUID

The full form of ``UUID`` is ``Universally Unique Identifier``. A UUID represents a **128-bit value that is unique**. The standard representation of UUID uses hex digits.

For example:

```
3c0969ac-c6e3-40f2-9fc8-2a59b8987918
cb7125cc-d78a-4442-b21b-96ce9227ef51
```
- [Class UUID](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html){.external}

``` java
import java.util.UUID;

    public static String createId() {Limit Your Availability

        UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        System.out.println("UUID generated - " + uuid);
        System.out.println("UUID Version - " + uuid.version());
        String id = uuid.toString();

        return id;

    }
```
### ``BorrowManager`` class

```java
public class BorrowManager {

   public static HashMap< String , Borrow> borrows = new HashMap<>();
}

```

### faker ``Users`` and ``Books``

```java
public static void createBooks(int number) {
// create faker object to use as
// builder for book
Faker faker = new Faker();
Book newbook;

for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    // create newbook without args
    newbook = new Book();
    // some people get nervous with this
    // be careful ...
    String bookId = InterfaceUtils.createUUID();
    newbook.setISBN(bookId);
    // title's book
    String bookTitle = faker.book().title();
    newbook.setTitle(bookTitle);
    // year's book
    int bookYear = faker.number().numberBetween(1000, 2023);
    newbook.setYear(bookYear);
    // borrows' book
    List<Borrow> borrows = new ArrayList();
    newbook.setBorrows(borrows);
    // author's book
    Author newauthor = new Author();
    newbook.setAuthor(newauthor);
    // add to hashmap
    books.put( bookId, newbook);
    // kill object
    newbook = null;
    }
}
```


## Tests

### `borrow` object test

[Test to create `Borrow` object](https://github.com/AlbertProfe/CifoJava2023/blob/12a97938cc4a0718ae66f08075a402af13354dce/LibraryProject/src/test/java/org/example/createObjectsTest.java#L73){.external}

### make-a-borrow test

[Test to make-a-borrow operation by simulate-console](https://github.com/AlbertProfe/CifoJava2023/blob/12a97938cc4a0718ae66f08075a402af13354dce/LibraryProject/src/test/java/org/example/makeBorrowByConsoleTest.java#L20){.external}


::: {.callout-important}
We decide to discuss this test in the near future, not now. It is more diffucult and **complex** than we thought.
