## Overview

::: {.summary}

ðŸ“˜ **import modules*

The magic of components lies in their ``reusability``: you can create components that are composed of other components.

But as you nest more and more components, **it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files**. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.

## Exporting and importing a component 


[What if you want to change the landing screen](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/importing-and-exporting-components){.external} in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move ``Gallery`` and ``Profile`` out of the root component file.

This will make them more **modular and reusable** in other files. You can move a component in three steps:

1. Make a new ``JS file`` to put the components in.
2. ``Export`` your function component from that file (using either ``default`` or named ``exports``).
3. ``Import`` it in the file where youâ€™ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for ``importing`` default or ``named exports``).


Here both ``Profile`` and ``Gallery`` have been moved out of ``App.js`` into a new file called ``Gallery.js``.
Now you can change ``App.js`` to import ``Gallery`` from ``Gallery.js``:

``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="Gallery.js"}
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
       <p>I love science!! Do you know what does STEAM mean? Come on, Albertus, answer the question! </p>
    </section>
  );
}

```

``` {.jsx .code-overflow-wrap filename="App.js"}
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Gallery />
  );
}
```
