## What is ArcGIS Pro?

ArcGIS Pro is a **modern, ribbon-based desktop GIS application** developed by Esri that provides professional mapping, analysis, and data management capabilities in both 2D and 3D environments.

### Key Features

- **64-bit architecture**: Better performance and memory management
- **Modern interface**: Ribbon-based UI similar to Microsoft Office
- **2D and 3D capabilities**: Seamless integration of 2D maps and 3D scenes
- **Project-based workflow**: Organized project structure with maps, layouts, and tools
- **ArcGIS Online integration**: Direct connection to cloud-based services
- **Advanced analysis**: Comprehensive geoprocessing and spatial analysis tools

### ArcGIS Pro vs ArcMap

| Feature | ArcGIS Pro | ArcMap |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Architecture | 64-bit | 32-bit |
| Interface | Modern ribbon | Traditional menus |
| 3D Support | Native 3D scenes | Limited (ArcScene) |
| Performance | Enhanced | Limited by 32-bit |
| Project Structure | Project-based | Document-based |
| Development | Active | Legacy (maintenance only) |
